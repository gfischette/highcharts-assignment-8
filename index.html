    <p> Chart data from <a href="https://data.un.org/default.aspx" target="_blank">United Nations Database, Nutrition and Health: Health expenditure.</a> </p>

   <p> The chart above shows the amount of money spent on health in five different countries in North America. These are the five countries in North America that have the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_North_American_countries_by_population" target="_blank">largest populations.</a> Out of all of them, the United States of America uses the biggest percent of its GDP (Gross Domestic Product) on health expenditure. Health expenditure is spent on multiple services, including hospital care and physician services, according to the <a href="https://www.ama-assn.org/about/research/trends-health-care-spending" target="_blank">American Medical Association.</a> For more information about health expenditure in various countries, check out the World Health Organization's <a href="https://apps.who.int/nha/database/Home/Index/en" target="_blank"> Global Health Expenditure Database.</a></p>

<p> Chart data from <a href="https://data.un.org/default.aspx" target="_blank">United Nations Database,  Population: Population growth, fertility, life expectancy and mortality.</a> </p>
<p>The chart above shows the life expectancy at birth for people in the five countries mentioned previously. Life expectancy is the average lifespan of the people who live in each country. It is important to keep track of life expectancy in various countries as it helps to show where there have been improvements in multiple areas, including health care. <a href="https://ourworldindata.org/life-expectancy" target="_blank">Our World in Data</a> helps to explain the importance of life expectancy. Despite the United States using the largest percentage of its GDP for health expenditure out of these five countries, the average life expectancy is still around 2 years lower than Canada's life expectancy. <a href="https://www.weforum.org/agenda/2020/01/us-life-expectancy-decline/" target="_blank">World Economic Forum</a> offers some insight on why life expectancy is not as high as expected. </p>
